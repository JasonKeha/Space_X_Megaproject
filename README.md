# Space_X_Megaproject

This is a repository showcasing a megaproject that I completed as part of my IBM Data Science Certificate.

This megaproject encompasses five sectors:

1. Data Collection: Demonstrating proficiency in collecting relevant data from various sources, such as web scraping or APIs.
2. Data Wrangling: Showing skills in cleaning, transforming, and organizing the collected data to ensure its quality and consistency.
3. EDA with Data Visualization: Displaying expertise in exploratory data analysis (EDA) by identifying patterns, trends, and relationships through visualizations and insightful charts.
4. Machine Learning Prediction: Exhibiting competence in selecting and implementing appropriate machine learning algorithms to build predictive models based on the collected and prepared data.
5. Bonus Sector: Presenting an additional sector that showcases a unique aspect of the project, such as a website, location analysis or any other relevant topic.

Throughout the megaproject, I demonstrate my skills and knowledge in various Python libraries and frameworks commonly used in data science and machine learning projects, including but not limited to:

- NumPy: a library for scientific computing with support for arrays and matrices.
- Pandas: a library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: a library for creating visualizations, such as line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
- Seaborn: a library for creating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, such as heatmaps and pair plots.
- Scikit-learn: a library for machine learning with support for classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
- And many more

This megaproject represents the culmination of my IBM Data Science Certificate journey, showcasing my abilities in data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and beyond.
